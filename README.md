# pprocessor



 PProcessor is a microprocessor designed using Altera FPGA Hardware/Software. This can be a great project to learn more about 
Hardware and Computer Programming by studying and modifying it. 
 I first designed and developed this microprocessor using Boolean Algebra and them converted into the Hardware Description Language (HDL). So I recommend the reading of "Digital Design" by Vahid, F.
 It has the systems of normal microprocessors: Aritmetic, I/O Instructions, Memory on Chip, etc. 
The hardware used for the implementation of the system was the Altera's Cyclone FPGA board and the Software was Altera Quartus 9.

Have fun! :)
